## Project Overview
This project — **IBM-FE-Interactive Form Validation** — is a responsive, front-end web application that validates user input in real time using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

It demonstrates modern front-end development principles like **form validation**, **UX/UI design**, and **error handling**, which are essential for real-world web development and frontend interviews.

The project aligns with **IBM Front-End Developer Project Phases (1–5)**, focusing on structured software design, implementation, enhancement, and deployment.
